## Finnish Flashcard App

Welcome to the Finnish Flashcard App!

This is the backend for the [Finnish Flashcard App](https://github.com/DarjaElina/finnish-flashcard-app-frontend), originally created as a Laravel course project at [Helsinki Business College](https://www.bc.fi/).  
It has since been extended into a personal portfolio and learning project.

The app is still under development, but the core features are already live 😁

🪩 You can check out the deployed application [here](https://finnish-flashcard-app-frontend.vercel.app/login).

### What's already there
1. Access demo flashcards  
2. Log in to create, edit, or delete your own flashcards  
3. Paginated list of shared words  

### What's coming
1. Search and filter functionality  
2. Game mode  


### Changes from version 1
1. Added user authentication  
2. Separated frontend and backend (previously React inside Laravel) for easier deployment  
3. Switched from Finnfast API to PostgreSQL with seeders — so words are always available, even if the Finnfast free tier ends 😁  


### Backend Tech Stack
- PHP, Laravel  
- Laravel Sanctum  
- PostgreSQL  
- Docker  

### 🙌 Acknowledgments

Originally built as part of a web development course.  
Now extended and maintained for learning and portfolio purposes.

Thanks for stopping by and checking out the Flashcard App! 💙
